# About
I'm a person that sometimes does a bit of reverse engineering, probably also other stuff
But most likely someone who abondons their blog after three entries and maybe makes another entry two years later, only to abondon it again.

## Contact
My e-mail is my usual username but on protonmail.com.
You can probably also reach me on twitter (again by 8051Enthusiast).

Is this how contact information works?
I hope so.
